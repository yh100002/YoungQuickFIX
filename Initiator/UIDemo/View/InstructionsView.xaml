                require data-dictionary tweaks and special handling for other quirks.
                <Bold>There is no application that will work on all FIX connections!</Bold>
                You must create your own.  This application is just an example.

                UIDemo intended to be run against the
                <Span FontStyle="Italic">Executor</Span> example program
                that comes with the QuickFIX/N source distribution.  Simply start
                <Span FontFamily="GlobalMonospace.CompositeFont">Executor.exe</Span>
                with the
                <Span FontFamily="GlobalMonospace.CompositeFont">executor.cfg</Span> that should be provided with it.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Once <Span FontStyle="Italic">Executor</Span> is running, you can click "Connect" above and UIDemo will connect to it.
                Use the features in the other tabs to send orders and news messages to <Span FontStyle="Italic">Executor</Span>
                and view the dummy execution reports that <Span FontStyle="Italic">Executor</Span> sends back.  You can also
                use the "MessageView" tab to see the raw FIX messaging.
